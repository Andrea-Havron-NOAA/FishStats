# Anova Model
$\mu_{i} = \beta_{0} + \alpha_{i}, i = 1,..p$, for p groups (levels)

mu = local mean
beta0 = global mean
Xbetas = local deviations
 
 matrix notation
$\mu = \beta_{0} + X\beta$
X is a design matrix and betas are local deviations from group mean

$y \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$

# Design Matrix X
For 3 groups and 5 observations of data, $y$
Two observations from group 1, two oberservations from group 2, one observation from group 3

$\beta = [\beta_[1], \beta_{2}, \beta_{3}]$
$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$dat = list(y = c(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3},y_{4},y_{5}), group = c(1,1,2,2,3))$
$par = list(\beta_{0},\beta = c(\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\beta_{3}))$
for(i in 1:3){
$mu = \beta_{0} + \beta[group[i]]$
}

$$
X\beta = [\beta_{1}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \beta_{2}, \beta_{3}]
$$
